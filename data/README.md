# Data Source
Data are based on the study ["Shen, Dwivedi, Majima, Horikawa, and Kamitani (2019) End-to-end deep image reconstruction from human brain activity. Front. Comput. Neurosci"](ttps://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncom.2019.00021/full). ([bioRxiv preprint](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/272518v1)) and consists of fMRI images and Stimulus images.

## fMRI data
The data are obtained from the following repository. 
[GitHub](https://github.com/KamitaniLab/End2EndDeepImageReconstruction)

## Stimulus images
The images used in the paper were initially used in [Horikawa & Kamitani, 2017](https://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms15037) and are needed to request for using because of the license issue.
The request process is in progress
